<h2 align="center">My Life</h2>

<p><h3 align="center">I moved to Miamisburg in 8th grade in 2011.I had originally lived in West Carrollton for more than 13 years of my life. On my first day I met a few people, and little did I know at the time that I would come to know these people for the rest of my time in High School, and some would become my friends.In Junior Year I decided to take a Tech Prep to expand my knowledge on computers. This class was called Info Tech I. In the first year of this class I learned the hardware of a computer, as well as the software of the computer. Some of this software also included usage of multiple operating systems. I then decided to take Info Tech II, which is to cover multiple topics such as HTMl, CSS, C++</h3></p>
